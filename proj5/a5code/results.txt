1) What features did you try?
We firstly added the features of bounding box area, in addition of the provided length and curvature. It improves the error rate of drawing.

Then we also tried other features, including bounding box ratio, writing speed, as well as top/bottom of sketch. 

Among these features, we found writing speed is not much relavant to our classification, so we ruled them out. 

On the other hand, box area is a good feature because the bounding box area of drawing tends to be much larger than text.

2) Were they continuous or discrete?

After trial and error, we decided to set bounding box ratio and area to be discrete, while others as continuous Gaussian.


3) How did you determine thresholds for discrete features?

We firstly set all features as continuous, and print them out to see the mean value and deviation.

Then we set the thresholds to classify the two labels. For example, the mean value of bounding box area for drawing is 85139, and for text is 14635. So we set the threshold to be 30000.

At last, we confirm that by trial and error.

4) How well did it work?
Our best classifier is much better than basic classifier, as indicated in the confusion matrix below.



Dataset:
We are using the entire dataset to train, and 10 files to test.



Confusion Matrix:
basic:
{'text': {'text': 40, 'drawing': 94}, 'drawing': {'text': 3, 'drawing': 160}}
best:
{'text': {'text': 91, 'drawing': 43}, 'drawing': {'text': 18, 'drawing': 145}}
